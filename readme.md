# CLI clone in rust

This is an app which clones how a CLI work, written in Rust.
The aim of this project is for Rust exploration.

## Running the Program

Use cargo.
Add file `database.db` in the root of the project for features requiring database.
Then from the root of the repository, run the following command:

```
cargo run
```

## Why CLI?

- Good for exploring filesystem-related API in Rust. Especially since Rust is a language for systems programming.
- No frontend, focus on the backend first (f u ratatui)
